            <div class="rest"><h5>📲 Resting in the afternoon 🛋</h5>
                <span>After a long day of doing online school I start to get tired around 4 pm, so I decided from then on 
                       not to do any requirements at 4 to 8 pm to rest. I usually sleep at 4 to 6, eat dinner, and rest more,
                       then do reqs pretty late at night. I feel more productive doing requirements around 10 pm to 2 am
                       and I know it's not exactly the most healthy habit, but it does work for me! If you aren't a
                       night person I wouldn't recommend staying up late at night, but I do recommend resting after 
                       studying as a reward.
                </span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="reqs"><h5>📚 Doing at least one requirement each day 📖</h5>
                <span>I finish at least one requirement or two minor tasks each day and then decide if I want to do more or not. 
                       There was one time I was feeling really tired but I convinced myself to start at least one thing since 
                       I had to get work done, even if I answered one question. The next day, I was super motivated and ended
                       up doing three projects in a day! If you get demotivated like me, I hope this system can help you if you
                       end up trying this out!</span>
            </div>

            <div class="setup"><h5>🪑 Pleasant set-up for studying 🗄</h5>
                <span>A relaxing set-up helps me get motivated to start studying or doing requirements. I do make a mess while 
                       studying but I make sure to clean up after every time :) I like to put notebooks I often use to take notes 
                       on my desk along with pens and other stationery so it doesn't look plain or too boring. If my set-up was 
                       unsettling to look at, I think I'd get unmotivated and distracted. </span>
            </div>

            <div class="music"><h5>🎼 Listening to music 🎧</h5>
                <span>Even though music with lyrics lift my spirits up, I recommend listening to music without lyrics so that 
                       there are no distractions. I get carried away when I listen to K-Pop, J-Pop, OPM music so I try lo-fi
                       and cafe bgm (background music) instead for studying. If I feel really tired though, I'd resort to listening 
                       to pop music to cheer myself up! </span>
            </div>

            <div class="lists"><h5>📝 Making to-do lists 📋</h5>
                <span>I like to make two to-do lists: one for all the requirements announced (with dates) and another for smaller
                       tasks (from heavy requirements) that I need to do within the day. Not only does this help in knowing what
                       I should do and keep track of, it also lets me know how to manage my time and when to rest. I think this 
                       method definitely helps me have no backlogs, even if it overwhelms me having so much to do. </span>
            </div>

            <div class="sleep"><h5>🛏 Having enough sleep 💤</h5>
                <span>Now I did mention that I usually do requirements late at night, but I also did say that I sleep after online
                       school to recharge. Even if I make sure to sleep earlier in weekends, I still end up waking up quite late but 
                       I feel so much more refreshed with lots of sleep. If you already have a fixed sleeping schedule please stick 
                       to it! My sleeping schedule is just what works for me.</span>
