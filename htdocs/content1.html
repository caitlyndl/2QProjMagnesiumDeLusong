            <div class="setup"><h5>🪑 Pleasant set-up for studying 🗄</h5>
                <span>A relaxing set-up helps me get motivated to start studying or doing requirements. I do make a mess while 
                       studying but I make sure to clean up after every time :) I like to put notebooks I often use to take notes 
                       on my desk along with pens and other stationery so it doesn't look plain or too boring. If my set-up was 
                       unsettling to look at, I think I'd get unmotivated and distracted. </span>
            </div>

            <div class="music"><h5>🎼 Listening to music 🎧</h5>
                <span>Even though music with lyrics lift my spirits up, I recommend listening to music without lyrics so that 
                       there are no distractions. I get carried away when I listen to K-Pop, J-Pop, OPM music so I try lo-fi
                       and cafe bgm (background music) instead for studying. If I feel really tired though, I'd resort to listening 
                       to pop music to cheer myself up! </span>
            </div>

            <div class="lists"><h5>📝 Making to-do lists 📋</h5>
                <span>I like to make two to-do lists: one for all the requirements announced (with dates) and another for smaller
                       tasks (from heavy requirements) that I need to do within the day. Not only does this help in knowing what
                       I should do and keep track of, it also lets me know how to manage my time and when to rest. I think this 
                       method definitely helps me have no backlogs, even if it overwhelms me sometimes having so much to do. </span>
