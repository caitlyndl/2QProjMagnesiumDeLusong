            <div class="rest"><h5>📲 Resting in the afternoon 🛋</h5>
                <span>After a long day of doing online school I start to get tired around 4 pm, so I decided from then on 
                       not to do any requirements at 4 to 8 pm to rest. I usually sleep at 4 to 6, eat dinner, and rest more,
                       then do reqs pretty late at night. I feel more productive doing requirements around 10 pm to 2 am
                       and I know it's not exactly the most healthy habit, but it does work for me! If you aren't a
                       night person I wouldn't recommend staying up late at night, but I do recommend resting after 
                       studying as a reward.
                </span>
            </div>
            
            <div class="reqs"><h5>📚 Doing at least one requirement each day 📖</h5>
                <span>I finish at least one requirement or two minor tasks each day and then decide if I want to do more or not. 
                       There was one time I was feeling really tired but I convinced myself to start at least one thing since 
                       I had to get work done, even if I answered one question. The next day, I was super motivated and ended
                       up doing three projects in a day! If you get demotivated like me, I hope this system can help you if you
                       end up trying this out. :)</span>
            </div>

            <div class="sleep"><h5>🛏 Having enough sleep 💤</h5>
                <span>Now I did mention that I usually do requirements late at night, but I also did say that I sleep after online
                       school to recharge. Even if I make sure to sleep earlier in weekends, I still end up waking up quite late but 
                       I feel so much more refreshed with lots of sleep. If you already have a fixed sleeping schedule please stick 
                       to it! My sleeping schedule is just what works for me.</span>
